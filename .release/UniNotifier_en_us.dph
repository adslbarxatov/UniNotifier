uNot (formerly know as UniNotifier) is the web resources supervisor service. This app provides the ability to be notified when the content of user-specified websites changes. In other words, about updates on them, which will be presented in the form of a text log. Only what the user has specified is loaded – all other objects (including ads) are ignored.

What does it offer?
- The settings section allows you to manage and design notifications.
- The main log provides a view of changes, access to source webpages from which they were received, and the ability to share them.
- A static service notification will inform you about the presence of new changes received in the background.
