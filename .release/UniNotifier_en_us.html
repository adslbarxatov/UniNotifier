<p><em><strong>uNot</strong></em> (formerly know as UniNotifier) is the web resources supervisor service.
This app provides the ability to be notified when the content of user-specified websites changes.
In other words, about updates on them, which will be presented in the form of a text log. Only what the user
has specified is loaded â€“ all other objects (including ads) are ignored.</p>
<p>What does it offer?</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>settings section</em> allows you to manage and design notifications.</li>
<li>The <em>main log</em> provides a view of changes, access to source webpages from which they were received, and the ability to share them.</li>
<li>A <em>static service notification</em> will inform you about the presence of new changes received in the background.</li>
</ul>
