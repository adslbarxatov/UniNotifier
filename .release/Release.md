_Changes for v 4.10.37_:
- Visible name of the application changed back to “UniNotifier” due to invisibility through the search algorithms;
- Windows: implemented downloading updates directly from the “About the app” interface (for other projects). This function requires DPModule. It allows you to download DPModule if it was not previously installed;
- Android: improved the GMJ request method;
- Android: added the ability to “mute” non-urgent notifications;
- Android: restored the individual update rate settings for each notification
