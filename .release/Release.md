_Changes for v 4.12_:
- Settings interface has been redesigned (settings grouped by type);
- Implemented the ability to check the availability of the specified resource: when notification will not be able to obtain its actual state it will throw the urgent notification about it. This function is inactive by default; it must be enabled for every needed notification manually;
- Android: system back button now allows you to return to the main log;
- Android: added some extra warnings about the app availability
