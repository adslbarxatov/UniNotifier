_Changes for v 4.5.17_:
- Windows: updated internal mechanism of checking for updates (applied compatibility with new GitHub theme);
- Unified text splitters for notifications;
- Fixed processing bug for main log: when user clicks on one of news with similar names of parent notifications, app targets only one of them;
- Fixed minor GMJ processing bugs;
- Windows: added the registry access checker: it will show recommended actions for the executable file when Windows doesnâ€™t allow saving settings
