_Changes for v 8.6_:
- Implemented a standalone interface that allows you to manually find and specify identifiers (parts of markup) for the target area of the web page when creating a new notification;
- The number of attempts by the Notification wizard to get the notification text during the setup stage has been increased to 5;
- The Notification wizard has been moved back from the context menu to the settings window as a separate button;
- The sorting order of notifications has been restored: disabled items are now at the end of the list;
- Added the `Doesn’t contain` comparator type for string values;
- Fixed a bug due to which the `Don’t show non-urgent` flag could remain active even after disabling the comparator and lead to missing necessary notifications;
- Fixed a bug due to which the numeric value comparator could return a false urgency trigger;
- The context menu for the main log now appears at the mouse position when you click an item;
- The video guides have been updated;
- ***The app settings interface has been completely rewritten***
