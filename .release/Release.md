- Android: app will now check the internet connection before requesting news in automated mode. So, it will not anymore use CPU and create unavailability alert when no internet connection is active;
- Implemented the ability to load / save the complete notifications set from / into the file. It allows you to preserve your settings in case of app reinstallation and / or migration from Windows to Android or backward;
- Windows: complete reset of texts of notifications when changing settings is now optional;
- Notification of unavailability will not be repeated after the first occurrence;
- Settings interface has been redesigned (settings grouped by type);
- Implemented the ability to check the availability of the specified resource: when notification will not be able to obtain its actual state it will throw the urgent notification about it. This function is inactive by default; it must be enabled for every needed notification manually
