### uNot (UniNotifier), the web resources supervisor service

***uNot*** (formerly know as UniNotifier) is the web resources supervisor service. This app provides the ability
to be notified when the status of user-specified websites changes. In other words, about their updates,
which will be presented in the form of a text log. Only what the user has specified is loaded – all other
objects (including ads) are ignored.

What does it offer?
- The *settings section* allows you to manage and design notifications.
- The *main log* provides a view of changes, access to source webpages from which they were received, and the ability to share them.
- A *static service notification* will inform you about the presence of new changes received in the background.
